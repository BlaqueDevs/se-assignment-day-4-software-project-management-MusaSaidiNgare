3. Agile methodology that include Scrum and Kanban is a methodology in Software Development that emphasizes on repetitive development, collaboration and flexibility. It focuses on delivering working software in short cycles and adapting to changing user requirements.
   Advantages of Agile Methodology
   -Flexibility.
   -Improved quality.
   -Enhanced collaboration.
   -Faster time to markets.
  Disadvantages of Agile Methodology
   -Creeping project scope.
   -Lack of structure.
   -Difficulty in measuring project progress.
  Waterfall methodology is a linear step by step approach that has phases which must be completed before another one begins. It is often pictured as a waterfall as the flow of work progresses downwards.
  Advantages of Waterfall Methodology
   -It is predictable.
   -It has a clear structure.
   -It is documented.
  Disadvantages of Waterfall Methodology
   -It is rigid.
   -Risks cannot be predicted.
   -It has limited user involvement.

4. When to use Agile Methodology:
   -Projects that have uncertain requirements.
   -Complex projects.
   -Small up to medium sized projects.
   -Innovative projects.
   An example is a startup developing a new mobile application with an uncertain market demand might use agile methodology as it allows fast iterations and adjustments based on user feedback.
   When to use Waterfall Methodology:
   -Projects with well-defined requirements.
   -Large scale projects.
   -Projects that must adhere to regulatory compliance.
   An example is a large software development project for a government agency with strict compliance requirements.

5. Testing methods:
   -Unit testing.
   -Integration testing.
   -System testing.
   -Acceptance testing.
   -Regression testing.
  Importance of maintaining high standards:
   -Customer satisfaction.
   -Cost effectiveness.
   -Regulatory compliance.
   -Reputation of the enterprise.
   -Success of the business.

6. Benefits of defining a project's scope:
   -Clear objectives.
   -Allocation of resources.
   -Risk management.
   -Stakeholder alignment.
   -Time management.
   A Work Breakdown Structure is a hierarchical decluttering of a project into smaller manageable tasks. It gives a visual representation of the scope of project thereby enhancing planning, organizing and tracking progress.
   Benefits of a Work Breakdown Structure:
   -Project clarity.
   -Project organization.
   -Allocation of resources.
   -Project progress tracking.
   -Risk management.

7. Benefits of a detailed project schedule:
   -Visibility.
   -Organization.
   -Allocation of resources.
   -Risk management.
   -Progress tracking.
   -Decision making.
   Gantt charts are tools for visualizing project schedules. They show tasks as horizontal bars with the length of the bar indicating the duration of the task. The bars are positioned in on a timeline to show their start and end dates.
   Benefits of Gantt Charts:
   -Visual representation.
   -Allocation of resources.
   -Progress tracking.
   -Showing task dependencies.

8. Common core issues in software:
   -Efficiency.
   -Accessibility.
   -Security.
   -Scalability.
   -User experience.
   -Cost-effectiveness.
   These problems are significant as they are the major constraints during the development of software. Addressing them leads to customer satisfaction and enhances trust.

9. -Clear focus and direction.
   -Prioritization of tasks.
   -Solution alignment.
   -Measurable outcomes.
   -Mitigation of risk.
   -Stakeholder alignment.

10. -Identify the problem that the software solution solves.
    -Highlight the solution and benefits the software offers.
    -Use a simple language
    -Illustrate the value of the software solution.
    -Use a compelling narrative.

11. Key features and functionalities:
